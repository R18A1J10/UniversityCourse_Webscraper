You will gain an understanding of the forces that have shaped the past and those that are shaping the world we live in today.\\nThis degree is distinctive for its international perspective on the past. It gives as much attention to political, economic, social and cultural developments within states as to the relations between them, in the belief that unless domestic and international history are studied together neither can be properly understood. The Department of International History is world renowned, and prides itself on delivering its ground-breaking research throughout the teaching programme.\\nBA History offers you a range of intellectual challenges: from broad survey courses, that look at particular themes or regions over a long period of time; to specialist courses that will develop your expertise in a topic, to the long essay or dissertation which allows you to pursue independent research in your third year. There is a very wide range of history courses to choose from, and there will be some opportunities to take outside options from other departments at the School. Throughout the degree, you will learn to analyse complex evidence from a variety of sources, to develop analytical powers and to present findings effectively. These skills and a broad knowledge of the development of the world around us are valued by many employers.\\nStudents on this programme also have the opportunity to receive a language specialism attached to their degree certificate and transcript - see the programme structure and courses section.\\nVisit the\\nDepartment of International History Virtual Undergraduate Open Day page\\nto find out more about studying in the department, access virtual resources and watch event recordings from our Virtual Undergraduate Open Day.'}\n"

You will gain an understanding of the forces that have shaped the past and those that are shaping the world we live in today.\\nThis degree is distinctive for its international perspective on the past. It gives as much attention to political, economic, social and cultural developments within states as to the relations between them, in the belief that unless domestic and international history are studied together neither can be properly understood. The Department of International History is world renowned, and prides itself on delivering its ground-breaking research throughout the teaching programme.\\nBA History offers you a range of intellectual challenges: from broad survey courses, that look at particular themes or regions over a long period of time; to specialist courses that will develop your expertise in a topic, to the long essay or dissertation which allows you to pursue independent research in your third year. There is a very wide range of history courses to choose from, and there will be some opportunities to take outside options from other departments at the School. Throughout the degree, you will learn to analyse complex evidence from a variety of sources, to develop analytical powers and to present findings effectively. These skills and a broad knowledge of the development of the world around us are valued by many employers.\\nStudents on this programme also have the opportunity to receive a language specialism attached to their degree certificate and transcript - see the programme structure and courses section.\\nVisit the\\nDepartment of International History Virtual Undergraduate Open Day page\\nto find out more about studying in the department, access virtual resources and watch event recordings from our Virtual Undergraduate Open Day.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
